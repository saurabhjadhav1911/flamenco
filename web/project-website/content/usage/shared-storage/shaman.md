title: Shaman Storage System
---

{{< toc >}}

Flamenco comes with a storage system named *Shaman*. It makes it possible to
have independence of render jobs, as well as as-fast-as-possible uploads to the
farm. Shaman is built into Flamenco Manager.

- **As fast as possible:** only those files that have been newly created or
  modified need to be sent to the render farm. Files that have been uploaded
  before are automatically skipped.
- **Independence of render jobs:** each render job uses the files as they were
  at the moment the job was submitted. Subsequent modifications to those files
  will not influence that render job.

## How does it work?

When a render job is submitted from Blender using the Shaman system, the add-on
communicates with Flamenco Manager. Together they determine which files are
already available on the shared storage, and which still need uploading. Once
that's done, Shaman will recreate the file layout required for the render job.

When the Shaman system is enabled, Flamenco Manager creates two directories in
the shared storage:
- `file-store`: all the uploaded files are stored here. They are not stored by
  their original filename, but rather by an identifier that is based on their
  contents. In other words, when a file is renamed but otherwise is unchanged,
  it will still be identified as the same file.
- `jobs`: each render job will get its own directory here. It will contain
  *symbolic links* (also known as *symlinks*) to the files in `file-store`. This
  way a file that was uploaded once can appear in multiple jobs simultaneously.

The process of submitting files via Shaman works as follows:

1. The Flamenco Blender add-on determines which files are necessary to render the current blend file.
2. It creates an *identifier* for this file, which consists of the SHA256 sum + the length of the file in bytes.
3. A list of all identifiers is sent to Flamenco Manager.
4. Flamenco Manager checks which of the identified files are already available in the shared storage, and which ones should be uploaded.
5. The Blender add-on uploads these files.
6. The Blender add-on sends the list of identifiers again, this time together with the desired file path. For example, it will send entries like `8c6c3a96efed9637dfe2ed4966b7b0b42ebf291c3ae23895b53ed1da51c468ff 512 path/to/file.blend`.
7. Flamenco Manager creates a *checkout* of the identified files, by creating the directory structure and using symbolic links to make the files available at the expected paths.

## Why is it called Shaman?

It was named this way because it uses SHA256 sums to identify files. Also it's a
[Sintel][sintel] reference, where one of the main characters is called *the shaman*.

## Requirements

Because of the use of *symbolic links* (also known as *symlinks*), using Shaman
is only possible on systems that support those. These should be supported by the
computers running Flamenco Manager and Workers.

### Windows

The Shaman storage system uses _symbolic links_. On Windows the creation of
symbolic links requires a change in security policy. This can be done as
follows:

{{< tabs "shaman-windows" >}}
{{< tab "Windows Home / Core" >}}

On Windows Home (also known as "core"), you'll need to enable Developer Mode:

1. Press the Windows key, type "*Developer settings*", and click Open or press
   Enter.
2. Click the slider under "*Developer Mode*" to turn it ON.

See [Developer Mode][devmode] for more information, including some security implications.

Alternatively you can use the freely available [Polsedit][polsedit] to enable
the *Create Symbolic Links* security policy.

[devmode]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development
[polsedit]: https://www.southsoftware.com/polsedit.html

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Windows Pro / Enterprise" >}}

On Windows Pro & Enterprise you need to enable a security policy.

1. Press Win+R, in the popup type `secpol.msc`. Then click OK.
2. In the _Local Security Policy_ window that opens, go to _Security Settings_ > _Local Policies_ > _User Rights Assignment_.
3. In the list, find the _Create Symbolic Links_ item.
4. Double-click the item and add yourself (or the user running Flamenco Manager or the whole users group) to the list.
5. Log out & back in again, or reboot the machine.

For more info see [the Microsoft documentation][secpol].

### Linux

For symlinks to work with CIFS/Samba filesystems (like a typical NAS), you need
to mount it with the option `mfsymlinks`. As a concrete example, for a user
`sybren`, put something like this in `fstab`:

```
//NAS/flamenco /media/flamenco cifs mfsymlinks,credentials=/home/sybren/.smbcredentials,uid=sybren,gid=users 0 0
```

Then put the NAS credentials in `/home/sybren/.smbcredentials`:

```
username=sybren
password=g1mm3acce55plz
```

and be sure to protect it with `chmod 600 /home/sybren/.smbcredentials`.

Finally `mkdir /media/flamenco` and `sudo mount /media/flamenco` should get things mounted.

The above info was obtained from [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/157140).

## Enabling Symlinks on SAMBA

If you're using SAMBA to host your Shared Storage, you'll also need to enable symlinks
on your `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file.

To do this you must add the `follow symlinks` and `wide links` options to your globals,
as exemplified below.

```
[global]
# Symlink Parameters
follow symlinks = yes
wide links = yes
unix extensions = no
allow insecure wide links = no
```

You may try adding these parameters to your share sub-section only insteadm,
if you need a more restricted configuration.

```
[global]
allow insecure wide links = yes
unix extensions = no

[share]
follow symlinks = yes
wide links = yes
```

This configuration has been tested with both Windows and Linux clients working together
over the same shared storage.

The above information was obtained from [UNIX Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/5120)

## Enabling or Disabling Shaman

Shaman is enabled by default on Linux and macOS. Since on Windows symbolic links
are not that commonly used, and require some additional system permission (see
[Windows](#windows)), Shaman is disabled by default there.

To enable Shaman, edit `flamenco-manager.yaml` and set `shaman.enabled: true`
like this:

```yaml
shaman:
  enabled: true
```

Similarly, it can be disabled by setting it to `false`.

{{< hint type=warning >}}

After changing this setting, be sure to **restart** Flamenco Manager, and
**refresh** the connection in the Blender add-on preferences. The last step is
necessary to make Blender fetch the updated configuration.

## Garbage Collection

Shaman keeps track of which files are still in use, and which files are not.
When a file in `file-store` is no longer symlinked from anywhere in the `jobs`
directory, it will automatically be deleted. When a job is submitted that
requires it, it will be reuploaded automatically.

The garbage collection system also keeps track of *when* a file in `file-store`
is used by a job. Even when it's no longer symlinked (because, for example, you
cleaned up the `jobs` directory) it will only be removed 31 days after its last
use in a render job.

The garbage collector can be configured in `flamenco-manager.yaml`:

```yaml
shaman:
  enabled: true
  garbageCollect:
    period: 24h0m0s
    maxAge: 744h0m0s
    extraCheckoutPaths: []
```

- `period`: the garbage collector runs every 24 hours by default. Change this
  setting to make it more/less frequent.
- `maxAge`: unused files will only be removed when they haven't been referenced
  for this amount of time.
- `extraCheckoutPaths`: a list of paths that should also be searched for
  symlinks, to prevent removal of files from `file-store`. This is not typically
  used; it may come in handy when transitioning a farm to use Shaman.
