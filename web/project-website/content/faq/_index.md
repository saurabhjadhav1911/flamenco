This is a list of frequently asked questions, with their answers. It's by no
means an exhaustive list.

## What do "Error: Cached job type is old" or "job type etag does not match" mean?

This means that you have to click on the little "Refresh" icon next to the job type:

## What does "command exited abnormally with code 1" mean?

It means that the program (probably Blender) exited with an error status. Take a
look at the task log, which you can access by going to the task in Flamenco's
web interface.


## â€‹What's the difference with OpenCue?

OpenCue is aimed at a different audience than Flamenco. OpenCue is a large and
complex project, and relies on a lot of components
([source](https://www.opencue.io/docs/getting-started/)), whereas Flamenco is
made for simplicity and use in small studios or at home, running on your own
hardware.
