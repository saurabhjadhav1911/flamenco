## Go Experimental!

The latest experimental version is: **{{< flamenco/latestExperimentalVersion
>}}**. This version is not guaranteed to be stable, so do not run this on
production systems. Or at least make a backup of your `flamenco-manager.yaml`
and `flamenco-manager.sqlite` files before you venture forth.

To see what's new, check [the changelog](https://projects.blender.org/studio/flamenco/src/branch/main/CHANGELOG.md).

<!--

{{< hint type=caution >}}
When **upgrading** from a previous experimental version, it is recommended to
start afresh with the following steps:

1. Cancel any running or queued job.
2. Shut down Flamenco Manager and all Workers.
3. Remove `flamenco-manager.yaml` and `flamenco-manager.sqlite`.
4. Download the new version and replace your old Flamenco files with the new ones.
5. Start `flamenco-manager` and go through the setup setup assistant again.
6. Don't forget to re-download the Blender add-on from the Manager's web
   interface, and install it. It has seen development as well, and will need to
   be upgraded.

## macOS "Silicon" builds

The macOS "Silicon" build does not ship with FFmpeg, because a trusted build for
this architecture is not provided by the FFmpeg project. This is why Flamenco v3
did not ship macOS/ARM64 builds. As of v3.3 this architecture will be included
in the official Flamenco builds, but still without FFmpeg binary.

You can install FFmpeg using [the ffmpeg Homebrew formula][brew] or any other
method. Once installed Flamenco Worker should find it automatically. If not,
place the ffmpeg executable into Flamenco's `tools` directory.
