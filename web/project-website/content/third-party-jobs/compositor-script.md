{{< hint >}}

This is a community-made job type. It may not reflect the same design as the
rest of Flamenco, as it was made for a specific person to solve a specific need.

{{< /hint >}}


This job type updates Blender's compositor nodes to work with Flamenco.

You'll need to do the following changes to support this workflow:

1. Download the [Flamenco Compositor Script ZIP file][compositorrepo] and extract it somewhere.
2. Copy `startup_script.py` to the configured Blender File Folder in your shared storage.
3. Copy `multi_pass_render.js` to the `scripts` folder in your Flamenco Manager installation folder (create it if it doesn't exist).
4. Add these variables to your `flamenco-manager.yaml` file:
    - `storagePath`: Your NAS path, multi-platform variable.
    - `jobSubPath`: Where the jobs are stored inside `storagePath`.
    - `renderSubpath`: Where the render output is stored inside `storagePath`.
    - `deviceType`: Compute Device Type to force. Do not set the variable if you wish to use whatever is available.
5. Submit your job from Blender with the corresponding Multi-Pass Job, it should
whatever compositor nodes you have set and correct the paths where necessary.

This has only been tested in an environment with [Shaman][shaman] enabled, but it should work without Shaman as well.
