title: Compositor Nodes and Multi-Platform Storage Paths
weight: 10

Job maintained by: Dylan Blanqu√©

If you need to use Blender's **Compositor** Nodes with *Flamenco*,
a Python Script and a Flamenco Job have been contributed to the community.

You'll need to do the following changes to support this workflow:

(It's recommended to use a symbolic link to the git repo files)

1. Clone the [Flamenco Compositor Script repository][compositorrepo]
(you'll need to install **git**) or download the files manually to a directory
in your Flamenco Manager/Server.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dblanque/flamenco-compositor-script.git
```
2. Copy or make a symbolic link of the **startup_script.py** file.
to the configured Blender File Folder in your *Network Attached Storage*.
3. Copy or make a symbolic link of the multipass javascript job to the *scripts*
folder in your Flamenco Manager Installation (Create it if it doesn't exist).
4. Add and configure the required variables from the *example Manager YAML*
*Config* to your Flamenco Manager YAML.
    * **storagePath**   - Your NAS path, multi-platform variable.
    * **jobSubPath**    - Where the jobs are stored inside storagePath.
    * **renderSubpath** - Where the Render Output is stored inside storagePath.
    * **deviceType**    - Compute Device Type to force *do not set the variable if*
     *you wish to use whatever is available*
5. Submit your job from a Blender Client with the corresponding Multi-Pass Job,
it should whatever compositor nodes you have set and correct the paths where
necessary.

**This has only been tested in an environment with Flamenco Manager and**
**Shaman enabled, but it should work without Shaman as well.**
